      <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>

      <h3>How people can benefit from principles of neuroplasticity.</h3>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity research introduces the idea that our brains are malleable, that we can reinforce the permanence of neural networks with repeated practice of an activity or access of memories. In other words <em>practice makes perfect</em>, or, more accurately, <em>access makes perfect</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If people understand that they can 'rewire' their brain to retain anything through practice and recollection, it makes it easier for them to adopt a growth mindset and achieve more.
      </p>


      <p>
        Knowing about neuroplasticity has encouraged me to be more proactive with working toward skills I want to attain, and retain useful knowledge. It has made me aware of the power of regular practice and recollection.
      </p>

      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>

      <p>
        A key aspect of neuroplasticity is that repetition of a thing strengthens and widens the pathways connecting that thing to the wider neural networks of the brain. As we all know, wider and stronger roads are easier and faster to travel down.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who become extremely proficient in something do so by repetitively accessing relevant neural networks i.e, they practice, regularly and precisely.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end result can be a poet reciting an entire poem from memory, or a pro-gamer rapidly entering sequences of commands almost unconsciously. It can even help a developer solve any JavaScript problem thrown at them.

     <h3>What a Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant.</h3>

      <p>
        Growth Mindset is the counterpoint to a Fixed Mindset. When you are in a fixed mindset, you tend to view your abilities as innate; you just have them and they are all you will ever have.</p>

      
        <h4>Some thoughts from a fixed mindset could be:</h4> 
    <blockquote>
          <p>
          "I've always been bad at science stuff, I can never understand what gravity waves are"
        </p> 
       <p><b>Or:</b></p> 
        <p>
          "I'm so clumsy, I won't even try to learn how to ride a bike".
        </p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>
        On the other hand, a growth mindset takes onboard that we can change our brains if we want. It means we focus on improving, through practice, open communication and asking for help.
      </p>
      <h4>Some growth mindset thoughts would be:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I want to learn about gravity waves, I can do this, I just need to put in the time and effort";
      </p>
        <p><b>Or:</b></p>
      <p>"I don't know how to ride a bike, so I'm going to learn!".</p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>
        As you can probably imagine, having a Growth Mindset enables you to try new things and better yourself; it is scientifically proven optimism!
      </p>
        
      <p>
        That being said, having a growth mindset is not something we just switch on and leave running for the rest of our lives. And, having a growth mindset in some areas does not stop you from having a fixed mindset in others.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can think mindset as an emotional state. Some days you're going to feel down, others you're going to feel fantastic, but either way you are going to have to actively manage it. Just as you would go easy on yourself on a bad day, reminding yourself that you are loved and valued, you also need to prompt yourself to find ways towards a growth mindset - sometimes everyday!</p>

      <h3>How I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey.</h3>

      <p>
        I personally find that when I get stuck on a problem, I can fluctuate between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.
        It is usually reflected in my internal monologue, sometimes I will think I'm really not good enough to ever learn how to overcome a problem. Other times I feel like I have no limitations, that I will learn how to overcome the problem. Learning about the different mindsets has allowed me to observe budding negative thoughts as a transition into a fixed mindset and stop it. I remind myself to keep at the problem, ask for help, revise; that I can change and develop.
    </p>
